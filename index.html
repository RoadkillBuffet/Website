                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We are Roadkill Buffet, MIT's <i>premier</i> improv comedy troupe. We hold a few shows every semester, which are free and a lot of fun! Our troupe is on a mission to bring humor to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.</p>
                <p>Why the name Roadkill Buffet? Well, we've been around for awhile, and no one is entirely sure. But legend has it that our founders, during the Improvaissance period, tried the name The A***** C****. Subsequently, they were nearly excommunicated by the Pope of Improv, so they went with their second-choice name instead. The rest is history.</p>

                 <h2>Auditions</h2>
                <p>We think improv is a ton of fun. Do you think improv is a ton of fun?</p>
                <p>Yes? Then audition to join Roadkill Buffet! No improv experience is necessary... really!</p>
                <p>Auditions will be held on <b>whenever we figure it out</b> at <b>6:45 pm (probably)</b> in room <b>24-121</b> (uh... maybe?), and are expected to last a few hours. (The room is tricky to find, so you can <b>meet us in Lobby 7 at 6:30pm</b>, and we'll walk over together.)</p>
                <p>Pizza will be provided.</p>
